	<p>Forms have been static, document-like user interfaces for centuries. 
		This article proposes a systematic approach for evolving forms towards more interactivity.

	<p>
		To identify specific and relevant research goals, I propose to look at forms as a user interface metaphor, 
		see my paper <a href="/publications.html#harms2013researchgoals">Harms, Johannes (2013)</a>:
		The form metaphor reminds us of historical (paper) forms - but many abilities of historic forms have been lost in the transition to digital media, 
			such as the possibility for making free annotations and personal copies. 
		Secondly, the form metaphor does not make fully use of the possibilites offered by digital media, 
			such as a variety of interaction styles, multimodal interaction, focus-and-context displays etc.
