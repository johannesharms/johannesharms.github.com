In a few days, we will present a <a href="/publications.html#harms2014gamification">new paper</a> [[1]] at the "NordiCHI 2014 conference":http://nordichi2014.org/ in Helsinki. In the paper, we put forth a well-structured process for gamifying online surveys. Download the <a rel="text" href="/publications/harms2014gamification.pdf">PDF</a> and read the paper!

Prior work on gamified surveys has primarily evaluated psychological and behavioral outcomes, but has been unclear about design methods and best practices. In contrast, our paper seeks to provide a well-structured design process that unifies Jarret's "three layers of form design" [[3]], general-purpose usability engineering processes, and the MDA (mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics) framework [[2]]. 


h2. Conceptual Foundations of Online Survey Gamification

The paper first provides theoretical foundations by discussing three relevant design dimensions (game elements according to the MDA framework, survey areas, and the design process).

		Three design dimensions in the gamification of online surveys: gamification (i.e., game elements from the MDA framework [[2]]), surveys (i.e., areas in the survey to be gamified), and form design (Jarret’s three layers of form design [[3]]).

h2. A Unified Design Process for Gamifying Online Surveys

Based on the above foundations, our paper [[1]] proposes a unified survey gamification process. The proposed process uses lists of game elements (aesthetics, dynamics, and mechanics) provided in related work [[2]] [[4]] for inspiration. It iteratively progresses in three phases:

<div class="figure">

* *1. Aesthetics and the Relationship Layer*
** Designers choose target aesthetics as goals for the intended user experience of the gamified survey. These decisions should be based on an analysis of users, tasks, and context (as typical for analysis phases in usability engineering process). Jarret's excellent book describes the analysis in terms of a "relationship layer" of form design.

* *2. Dynamics and the Conversation Layer*
** To realize the intended aesthetics, designers choose suited game dynamics that will produce the aesthetics when played by users. In a gamified survey, game dynamics correspond to how form filling changes over time, e.g., whether it becomes more easy or difficult and whether time pressure build up. This time-variant behavior is also captured in Jarret's "conversation layer" of form design.

* *3. Mechanics and the Conversation and Appearance Layers*
** To produce the intended dynamics, designers choose suited game mechanics. Game mechanics are the basic, interactive building blocks of a game, e.g., points, badges, leaderboards, avatars... Design activities in this phase correspond to detailed UI design, as e.g. described in Jarret's "appearance and conversation layers" of form design.

* *Prototyping, Evaluation and Iteration*
** The resulting concept should be prototyped and evaluated in a formative usability evaluation. This will typically lead desigerns to correct errors and re-consider design decisions in order to improve the gamified survey. The modified concept should be prototyped and evaluated again.

h2. Pre-liminary Results

An earlier variant of the process has been proposed in Birgit Wlaschits' diploma thesis [[4]]. She also employed the process in a case study where she designed a gamified online survey, some screenshots of which shall be presented in the following:

Experience from the above case study strongly supports the usefulness and applicability of the proposed process. We therefore put forth the MDA-based process for gamifying online surveys for further discussion, evaluation, and application in the CHI community.
