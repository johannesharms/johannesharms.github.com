Today I have accidentally sent a love message to a friend and colleague of mine. I blame it on the modal user interface of my default Android texting app.

"Modal user interfaces":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(computer_interface) are "modal with respect to a given gesture when (1) the current state of the interface is not the user's locus of attention and (2) the interface will execute one among several different responses to the gesture, depending on the system's current state" [[1]]. The text messaging (sms) app that came with my Android phone uses modes to remember the recipient.

I think the above mockup explains pretty well what happened this morning. The result is awkward and embarrassing. And a nice example of how bad usability destroys security - "the mode error did not kill anybody":http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/is_visual_feedback_enough_why_modes_kill/, but a private message was read by an uninteded recepient!

I now use the "TextSecure":https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/ app instead: When I close and re-open the app, it does not open previous conversations but exits the old mode. It furthermore helps to avoid confusion by showing contact pictures of the people I am texting with. It even offers encrypted communication, provided the recipient also uses TextSecure. 

Conclusion: I heavily recommend against modal user interface design and for using sms apps that hinder sending embarrassing messages.
